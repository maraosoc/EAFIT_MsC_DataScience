# Computer vision data loader

In this lab your task is to produce images as quickly as possible, so that they are available to train a machine learning model. To achieve it, you will need to learn about Iterators and concurrency in Python. Moreover, you will have a chance to experiment with the cost of reading from the local disk, a remote server and memory.

If you need a refresher on the topics needed to solve the challenge, read:

* https://realpython.com/python-concurrency/
* https://realpython.com/python-iterators-iterables/
* https://realpython.com/intro-to-python-threading/

Or even practice a little bit first with: https://github.com/open-homeworks/concurrent-downloads


If you are ready, follow along the `experiment.ipynb` file and come up with the best possible data loader, one that optimizes for fast image availability, as well as low memory requirements.
